                    <h2>SCHOOL PROJECTS</h2>
                    <p>Through these small projects I learned the basics of HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and React at Progmatic Academy.</p>
                    <p>Each assignment served to practice the application of a principle or to teach us best practices.</p>
                    <p>Though coming up with a design was not that important for these exercices, I have always made it a point to make the end result not only functional, but also pleasing to the eye.</p>

                    <h2>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h2>
                    <p>Learning does not stop once you are out of school! It should not, anyway.</p>
                    <p>These personal projects are my way of expanding my knowledge on my own and building on the solid foundations I got out of the bootcamp at Progmatic.</p>
                    <p>They are also a lot of fun!</p>
